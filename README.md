# Enigma

My first personal project with Java swing framework. This program is a clone of the Enigma machine the German army
used to encode their messages in WWII. Alan Turing cracked this which assisted in the winning of the war, all rotors and 
reflectors in this project are coded exactly as they were in WWII.
